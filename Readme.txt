Contains the computer code to simulate two-trophic phytoplankton communities
based on empirically measured traits and mechanistic species interactions

Generating virtual plankton species:
generate_plankton.py
	Contains functions to create plankton species with traits,
	Most important function is "generate_plankton"

phytoplankton_traits.py
	Loads the empirically measured traits for phytoplankton species

zoop_traits.py
	Loads the empirically measured traits for phytoplankton species

Functions needed for simulations
plankton_growth.py
	Contains growth functions of phytoplankton, use either
	"per_cap_plankton_growth" for per capita growth rates
	"plankton_growth" for actual growth rates
	"convert_ode_to_log" for actual growth rates but log converted


Creating figures:
plot_*.py generates the corresponding Figure Figure_*.pdf.
	plot_ap_* create figures for the appendix
	plot_int_* create figures not present in publication and only used internally
	However, many of these depend on precomputed simulations and load the files
	generated by sim_* scripts. These are not stored here due to size limitations.
	In case you are interested in these files, please contact Jurg W. Spaak, j.w.spaak@gmail.com
