Contains the computer code to simulate two-trophic phytoplankton communities
based on empirically measured traits and mechanistic species interactions

Generating virtual plankton species:
generate_plankton.py
	Contains functions to create plankton species with traits,
	Most important function is "generate_plankton"

phytoplankton_traits.py
	Loads the empirically measured traits for phytoplankton species

zoop_traits.py
	Loads the empirically measured traits for phytoplankton species


Functions needed for simulations
plankton_growth.py
	Contains growth functions of phytoplankton, use either
	"per_cap_plankton_growth" for per capita growth rates
	"plankton_growth" for actual growth rates
	"convert_ode_to_log" for actual growth rates but log converted

assembly_time_fun.py
	Simluates the community assembly.
	Most important function is "assembly_richness"
	For examples on how to use see sim_assembly_mean.py nd similar

NFD_equilibrium.py
	Contains functions to compute niche and fitness differences of two competing
	zooplankton species


Simulations
sim_* simulates the corresponding files
	A short description of which simulation is run is at the start of each sim_* file
	sim_assembly_* compute the assembly process and the corresponding species richness
	The other sim_* files compute the corresponding niche and fitness differecnes
	They are constructed such that multiple of these scripts can be run
	in parallel. By saving at the correct location and checking whether the corresponding
	file exists no computation will be made twice.
	However, these computation take very long (several 100 hourse CPU time).
	The created files are not shared publicly due to size limitations, if you want them,
	please contact us, we're happy to help.


Combining the simulated data
precombine_NFD_simulations.py
	Combines multiple replicas of files for NFD computation into one single npz file

combine_assembly_simulations.py
	Combines the multiple npz files generated by the sim_assembly_* files into csv files
	containing only the relevant information for the plot_* scripts

combine_NFD_simulations.py
	Combines the multiple npz files generated by the other sim_* files into csv files
	containing only the relevant information for the plot_* scripts

Creating figures:
plot_*.py generates the corresponding Figure Figure_*.pdf.
	plot_ap_* create figures for the appendix
	plot_int_* create figures not present in publication and only used internally
	However, many of these depend on precomputed simulations and load the files
	generated by sim_* scripts. These are not stored here due to size limitations.
	In case you are interested in these files, please contact Jurg W. Spaak, j.w.spaak@gmail.com
layouts.py
	Contains layout information for consistency between different figures
